soapworks
=========

Java Library to Bootstrap SOAP / WSDL Development.



Exception handling
------------------
exceptions are named by who's to blame, not who threw the exception.
a server can throw a ClientException just like in http a server
can return a code 400 (client error).


Status
------
soapworks has been in development at http://www.optimaize.com for use in the http://www.nameapi.org web services for a long time, and is now published on GitHub. It contains a full working example. This readme should be longer.
